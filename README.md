Blackjack
=========
Description:
Our project was to build a blackjack that mirrored the rules of Single-deck 21/blackjack, famous for being played in just about every casino in the world!  Every round, the player and dealer both start off with 2 cards.  The dealer only exposes one card while the player can see his cards only and the dealer’s one card.  The objective of the game, in a nutshell, is for the player to get a higher score than the dealer without “busting.”

Rules:
•	Player has the first option to hit or stay once the cards are dealt.
•	If the player gets a score higher than 21 he automatically loses.
•	Once the player “Stays,” the dealer has an option to either tie or beat his score.
•	The dealer can also bust as well.
•	All scores are based off the face value of the card.  Jacks, Queens, Kings, are all worth 10 each.  Aces are optional and can be worth either 1 or 11.

Deviations from “casino” blackjack:

If the player gets a 21 with his first two cards he does not automatically win (in the casino he normally would).  

Instructions:

1.	Welcome screen displays a prompt for the player to either Hit, Stay, or Exit the game.  The cards are automatically dealt.
2.	Player chooses which option he wants and the game will determine the winner.
3.	At the end of each round, the player has the option of leaving the game.

Challenges:
•	Figuring out how to deal with Aces.  When to count it as an 11 and when to count it as a 1.

Options for future builds:

Because we were the first group to present our time was limited.  There were several options we wanted to implement such as a bank (keep track of how much money everybody can bet and win/lose), multiplayer functionality, and a virtual assistant that tells your what your odds are of winning for either hitting or staying.
